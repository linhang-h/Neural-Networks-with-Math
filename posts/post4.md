# Introduction to G-CNNs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) possess the distinguishing property of translation invariance in their convolutional layers, allowing them to maintain the inherent spatial structure of image data. This characteristic enables CNNs to excel in various complex tasks, including edge detection, feature extraction for object recognition, and semantic segmentation.
