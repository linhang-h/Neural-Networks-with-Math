# Introduction to G-CNNs

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) possess the distinguishing property of translation invariance in their convolutional layers, allowing them to maintain the inherent spatial structure of image data. This characteristic enables CNNs to excel in various complex tasks, including edge detection, feature extraction for object recognition, and semantic segmentation.

However, image data often come with additional structures, such as rotational or reflectional symmetries, which are not built-in features for traditional CNNs. Group-equivariant CNNs (G-CNNs) extend the translation-invariance property of traditional CNNs into equivariance of more general symmetry groups, such as rotations, reflections, or scaling transformations. This is achieved by defining convolutional layers over group domains rather than spatial domains, enabling the network to model transformations within the group as inherent symmetries. As a result, G-CNNs can efficiently represent and process data with these symmetries, reducing redundancy in feature learning and improving performance on tasks where such invariances are critical, such as medical imaging, where organs can appear in various orientations, or astrophysical data analysis, where rotational symmetry is often encountered.
